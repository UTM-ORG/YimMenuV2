            # YimMenuV2

            Unoficial experimental menu for GTA 5: Enhanced following original repository.

            ## How to use

            1. Download YimMenuV2 from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/UTM-ORG/YimMenuV2/releases/tag/nightly).
            3. Download an injector, such as [Xenos](https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos).
            4. Open Rockstar Launcher, select Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced, go to settings, and disable BattlEye. If you are using Steam or Epic Games, you may have to pass the -nobattleye command line parameter as well.
            5. Launch GTA V, then use your injector to inject YimMenuV2.dll at the main menu.

            ## How to open the menu?

            Press the `INSERT` key or `Ctrl+\` to open the menu
            
            ## Common issues

            ### I keep getting desynced from public sessions every five minutes
            We currently do not have a BattlEye bypass, and legitimate hosts will eventually remove you due to a heartbeat failure. There is currently no way to stop this other than using an actual (private) bypass.

            ### I have a blackscreen or GFX_STATE_ERROR
            We recommand you stop using DLSS or other Frame Generation settings.

            ## Notice about Nightly builds
            These are nightly builds of YimMenuV2, they are provided for testing purposes only:
            - Test if your build environment produces a broken YimMenuV2.dll
            - Test if source code is out of date and no longer compatible with the current version of Grand Theft Auto V: Enhanced

            If you wish to use this menu as-is you are on your own, no warranty is provided.
