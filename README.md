## Common issues

### I keep getting desynced from public sessions every five minutes
We currently do not have a BattlEye bypass, and legitimate hosts will eventually remove you due to a heartbeat failure. There is currently no way to stop this other than using an actual (private) bypass.

### I have a blackscreen or GFX_STATE_ERROR
We recommand you stop using DLSS or other Frame Generation settings.
